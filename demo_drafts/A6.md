## Roadmap Update

Since our last release, we have transitioned from foundational setup to our **first early proof of concept (PoC) build**.  
The focus this week was backend deployment, dataset optimization, and preparing the app for next week’s first round of user testing.

We made substantial progress on **M2 (Get a Personalized Restaurant List)** and **M3 (Adjust Distance and Filter Categories)** — both now powered by our live backend services.  
**Backend API Server:** [https://palate-api-322049939075.us-central1.run.app/docs]

Meanwhile, **M1 (Create an Account and Build a Personalized Profile)** has Firebase Authentication fully implemented. We are currently finalizing onboarding design and data mapping to connect user preference data with restaurant metadata.
**Deployed Frontend Web App:** [https://palate-cve8jj.flutterflow.app/]

## Key Achievements

- **Deployed Cloud Run backend server** with two live endpoints:  
  - `GET /place/{place_id}`: Retrieves restaurant data using the Kaggle dataset in Firestore and selective Google Places enrichment.  
  - `POST /nearby-restaurants`: Fetches nearby restaurants based on user location and cached Firestore data.  

- **Curated a Toronto-only Firebase dataset** of approximately **5,000 restaurants**, filtered and cleaned from an initial 10,000+ entry [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kevinbi/toronto-restaurants).  

- **Integrated selective Places API caching**, enabling cost-efficient enrichment (photos, summaries, and live status) only when necessary.  

- **Established CI/CD pipeline** using Google Cloud Build and Artifact Registry for seamless deployment and version control.  

- **Frontend nearing full integration**, featuring a dynamic feed and real-time filters connected to live backend data.

## Roadmap Change Details



These changes together enable a scalable, low-cost backend optimized for the MVP testing phase.

---

## UI/UX

Design efforts focused on **user onboarding** and defining how we can represent a user’s **“restaurant personality”** — a stable, data-driven profile that transcends short-term mood or craving.  
The onboarding flow aims to take **20–40 seconds** and balance personality questions with preference capture to minimize user drop-off.

This work is closely tied to M1 and the forthcoming onboarding-to-recommendation mapping system (ADR 020 alignment).

No formal user research was conducted this sprint. The **next release** will include insights from our early PoC testers.

---

## Decision Logs

- **ADR 016 – Replacing Google Places Nearby Search:**  
  Replaced high-latency API calls with a local Kaggle dataset for faster and cheaper restaurant retrieval.  
- **ADR 017 – Restricting Dataset to Toronto Only:**  
  Reduced dataset to ~5,000 Toronto restaurants to improve data quality and simplify MVP scope.  
- **ADR 018 – Using Agent-Based Search:**  
  Implemented LLM-driven fuzzy matching for better interpretability and flexible query handling.  
- **ADR 019 – Multi-Project GCP Setup:**  
  Temporarily kept multiple projects to maximize free-tier credits and reduce operating costs.  
- **ADR 020 – Selective Google Places API Calls with Caching:**  
  Adopted a hybrid approach — limited Places API usage with Firebase caching for key metadata enrichment.

## Summary

This release marks a **critical turning point** — our platform is now live end-to-end with real restaurant data, deployed APIs, and an interactive frontend.  
We are ready to begin **early user testing next week**, focusing on feedback around onboarding, search relevance, and personalized recommendations.  

Our backend stack, dataset, and UI now align with our long-term goal: **a hyper-personalized restaurant experience built on smart data and scalable architecture**.
