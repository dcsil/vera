# Diversity in The Right Rec

At ***The Right Rec***, our goal is to build the most trustworthy and inclusive recommendation system ever. 

As such, we know that the diversity of our company will play a significant role in the dynamic of our team, our approach to customer outreach, and ultimately, the success of our product. As we strive to revolutionize how we search and review products and businesses, having a diverse, world-focused view is essential. In this document, we will discuss each team member’s areas of expertise and how they will benefit our product, including areas of potential bias, limited experience, and limited areas of diversity.


## Team Background, Strengths, and Expertise

Our team brings together members born in different parts of the world and based in both Canada and Singapore. This gives a global perspective that will strengthen our approach to building an inclusive and innovative recommendation system. Addditionally, each member brings a unique combination of technical expertise, entrepreneurial experience, and strategic insight that together form a well-rounded foundation for our project.

**Franco**, a Filipino-born Canadian, provides a strategic and R&D-focused mindset that transcends any single discipline. With a multidisciplinary background ranging from neuroscience and psychology to web development and analytics, he has played a hands-on role contributing to research and startups around the world—including ones in Canada, Singapore, Switzerland, and the U.S. As such, he thrives in unfamiliar environments and adapts quickly, making him a versatile member for shaping and iterating on the viability of our company.

**Chris**, a Korean-born Canadian, comes from a highly entrepreneurial and technical background. With prior experience both creating and working for startups, particularly in AI-driven product development, he plays a key role in building and subsequently scaling our platform. His intimate understanding of industry and product development means he will be working carefully on our software to ensure it remains ahead of the latest digital trends and technologies.

**Kyoeun**, our first Singaporean member, bridges the gap between software development and market insight through her studies in Business Analytics Computing. Her dual experience as a programmer and market analyst for companies in both Canada and Singapore has equipped her to provide invaluable business expertise and ensure the platform scales according to real market needs.

**Charlyn**, our second Singaporean member, brings an extremely robust engineering and programming background through her studies in Computer Engineering. With experience in student teams, research, and robotics internships, she is not only familiar with building software with real-world applications, but doing so in fast-paced collaborative environments—making her essential for the timely and practical development of our platform.

**Kai**, our third Singaporean member, specializes in human-focused software development and innovation through his studies in Computer Engineering and Innovation and Design. His practical experience with large language models, embedded systems, and multimodal data collection makes him a fitting member for recommender system development, where data processing and analysis are essential. His technical mindset means he will play key role in integrating advanced technologies into our platform.


## Gaps in Our Diversity

While every member brings a unique skill, ranging from software engineering to research to business analytics, we do recognize limitations in our team’s diversity and how this may ultimately reflect in the development of our product. 

First, our **cultural and geographic representation** is limited to Asia and North America. Though we draw on experiences from Canada and Singapore, and all of us have ancestry stemming across Asia, this covers only a small fraction of the world and the total addressable market. We lack perspectives from Europe, South Asia, Latin America, Africa, and other regions. This gap may affect our ability to design a recommendation system that resonates with users in markets we have little direct exposure to.

Second, **gender diversity** is limited. While our team includes both male and female members, non-binary or other gender identities are unfortunately not represented. This lack of gender representation may restrict how inclusive our design choices are when it comes to digital identity, personalization features, and user categories.

Third, **socioeconomic diversity** is not well-represented. All of us share a background of pursuing higher education in well-resourced institutions. As a result, we may make unconscious assumptions about user access to technology, infrastructure, and social media use, which may not hold true in markets outside of well-developed countries.

Finally, our **academic backgrounds** are heavily concentrated in technical and analytical fields. While this gives us a strong engineering capacity, it leaves us without expertise from disciplines such as sociology, design, or cultural studies, which may be relevant for understanding how people form digital identities and how recommendations influence social behavior.

These gaps matter because our project centers on building a recommendation system that **takes into account where people go and what they enjoy.** If we don’t account for different cultural contexts, we might overemphasize certain types of recommendation categories and underrepresent others. To address this, we plan to seek feedback from diverse user testing and consultation with subject matter experts, to complement what our team alone cannot provide.


## Subject Matter Experts

While our team has a strong technical and analytical foundation, we recognize that building a product around digital identity and social exploration requires more than engineering and business expertise. There are several domains where outside experts would be extremely helpful in filling gaps in our knowledge.

First, it is important to note that forming a “digital identity” requires an understanding of how people form self-concepts, how social comparison works, and how digital spaces affect relationships. While Franco has a background in psychology, a subject matter expert in sociology or social psychology could provide further insights into issues like peer influence and identity categories, to ensure our means of categorization remain inclusive, flexible, and avoid reinforcing stereotypes.

Second, because one of our main goals is to design a transparent recommendation system, we could benefit from expertise in human-computer interaction (HCI) and UX design. Experts in this area could advise us on how to communicate and ultimately explain recommendations in ways that balance transparency with simplicity.

Third, the ethical and legal dimensions of our system are extremely important. For our recommendation system, we must collect enough data to ensure meaningful recommendations while not collecting so much as to risk privacy concerns. To strike the right balance, we have already begun to consult subject matter experts in recommender systems and large-scale user management, and will also meet with experts in data ethics and technology law.

By seeking guidance from subject matter experts outside of simply software development, we can ensure that *The Right Rec* is not only technically sound but socially responsible and aligned with user needs.


## Unconscious Bias

Beyond gaps in our group structure and areas of expertise, our team must also be mindful of unconscious biases that could influence our teamwork and our product. 

One major risk is cultural bias in exploration patterns. Given our team’s contexts in Canada and Singapore, we may overvalue activities and restaurants common to urban, high-tech environments while overlooking rural, community-based, or lower-cost activities and restaurants. This bias could lead to our recommendation system unintentionally privileging individuals from one lifestyle over another.

Another risk is algorithmic bias in identity construction. Although our main goal is transparency, we do recognize that categorizing people into tags like “coffee-lover” or “jazz-listener” may risk oversimplifying users’ identities or reinforcing stereotypes. Therefore, to avoid jeopardizing trust in our platform, it is integral that we design it to avoid making users feel misrepresented within rigid or potentially offensive categories.

Finally, within the team itself, we acknowledge that there is a possibility of bias in decision-making dynamics. Because most members come from strong technical backgrounds, we may unconsciously prioritize complex engineering solutions over “softer,” but equally important, considerations such as usability, inclusivity, and long-term ethical implications.

To mitigate these risks, we will make an effort to:
- Conduct user interviews with diverse groups, including ones beyond our immediate social circle, to challenge our initial assumptions when testing the product;
- Consult with subject matter experts in data ethics, recommender systems, sociology, and more to guide our design decisions with external insight;
- Regularly review team discussions to ensure non-technical perspectives (e.g., ethics, business, strategy) are considered alongside technical solutions.

While we value our team’s multicultural and cross-cultural background, we understand he importance of acknowledging these unconscious biases early. We hope that by taking steps to broaden our perspectives, we may not only foster a more balanced team dynamic but ultimately design a recommendation system that balances transparency with fairness, trust, and inclusivity.

## Moving Forward

As *The Right Rec* develops, we recognize that the strength of our team extends beyond technical depth and entrepreneurial background. Our global mix of members from Canada and Singapore gives us a valuable cross-cultural perspective, but we are also mindful of the limits of our diversity and the risks of unconscious bias. By being transparent about these blind spots, seeking guidance from subject matter experts, and actively engaging with users beyond our immediate circles, we aim to ensure our platform reflects fairness, inclusivity, and trustworthiness.

Ultimately, our goal is not only to build a recommender system that provides accurate suggestions but also one that earns user confidence by clearly explaining *why* recommendations are made. This commitment to transparency, inclusivity, and continuous reflection will allow The Right Rec to evolve into a product that resonates with a wide variety of users and strengthens the social connections at the heart of our platform.
