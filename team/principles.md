# Team Principles
*This document is subject to evolve.*

## Communication
Our primary communication platform will be a private WhatsApp groupchat. To maintain alignment in a fast-moving environment, each member is expected to share an update on daily basis. Updates should follow a consistent format that includes: (1) current tasks, (2) next steps, and (3) blockers. If a member is unable to work on the project during a given period, they must inform the team of their unavailable timeframe and provide a reason, which may be as simple as another course commitment such as midterms.  

Frequent updates are essential for transparency. Even if work is being completed, failure to provide regular updates will result in a warning. This ensures we remain coordinated, avoid overlapping effort, and sustain efficiency in a startup-like environment where roles and tasks often shift. For emergencies, we will maintain a shared list of phone numbers. Calls and texts should only be used in rare, time-sensitive situations that require immediate attention.

## Meetings
The team will hold two core meetings each week. The first will serve as a sprint planning session, where members provide updates, redistribute work as needed, refine the backlog, and adjust goals. The second will function as a combined demo day and retrospective, where each member presents their progress, even if incomplete, followed by team-wide peer review. Approved work will then be merged into the `dev` branch at the beginning of the following sprint.  

Additional working sessions will take place as necessary. While not always requiring full participation, sessions focused on brainstorming, product direction, or vision will encourage active involvement from all members. Each team member is responsible for notifying the group if they will miss a hard set meeting. If a recurring scheduling conflict arises, they must alert the team so that a new meeting time can be defined that works for everyone.

## Work and Responsibilities
Tasks will be managed using Notion. Sprint tasks will be tracked on kanban boards, while a single Gantt chart will provide a roadmap for the semester. A formal project manager role will be established to ensure tickets are kept up-to-date and that the boards remain well-organized.  

As we are all students balancing other courses, asynchronous collaboration will be especially important. Members should maximize the use of async communication channels and are encouraged to provide video walkthroughs or updates using tools such as Loom. This allows for clear explanations of work progress and decisions without requiring all members to be present simultaneously.  

Peer reviews are central to our workflow. Work should be developed on feature branches, never directly in `dev`. During demo day, members will present their progress for review, and once consensus is reached, approved changes will be merged into `dev` at the start of the next sprint.

## Team Values
We value a learning mindset. Each member brings a unique background and expertise, and everyone should feel encouraged to contribute while remaining open to learning from others, even when outside their comfort zone. Our team embraces the challenges of working in a fast-paced, high-pressure environment, recognizing that disagreements and clashes of opinion are part of the process.  

Discussions should be driven by evidence rather than gut instinct. Critiques and alternative ideas must be supported by tangible results, such as prototypes, benchmarks, or A/B test results, rather than untested hypotheses. For example, if a member suggests an alternative workflow or optimization, they should provide a proof of concept to substantiate their argument.  

Above all, we are committed to professionalism paired with camaraderie. We aim to foster a supportive, safe environment where healthy conflict is managed constructively, and where we collaborate not merely as a group of individuals, but as a cohesive and motivated team.
