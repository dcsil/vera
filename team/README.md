### Team Leader
[Franco Miguel Valencia - Leader, Engineering, and Strategy](./francomiguel_valencia.md)  

Franco has been selected as our leader due to his balanced background spanning research, project management, public presentations, and experience working at a startup. Additionally, he has ample experience leading, founding, and organizing multiple clubs and student publications, making him used to giving equal consideration to everyone's opinions and a fitting choice for overseeing our startup's progress.

Although Franco is our current elected leader, his responsibilities will be shared among the other startup members as best as possible, and include but are not limited to:
- Ensuring the timeliness of project deliverables and progress
- Acting as an intermediary between teaching staff and the group
- Helping organize meetup times
- Overseeing the submissions of assignments and other deliverables
